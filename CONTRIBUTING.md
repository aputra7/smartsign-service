* [Git Commit Messages](#git-commit-messages)

## Workflow

* `master` branch MUST stay clean and nothing should be pushed there directly.
* When you want to start working on a feature or a bug fix, always check off of master.
* Use descriptive branch names, for example `user-authenticator`.
* 1. Fork
* 2. Make changes locally and keep pushing to your branch.
* 3. When you're ready to push the changes, submit a pull request and @mention people to get your PR reviewed. 
* DO NOT MERGE your pull request to master until everyone you mentioned has reviewed your code and "thumbs up-ed".

## Submitting Issues

* You can create an issue [here](https://github.com/gtkesh/smartsign-service/issues/new), but
  before doing that check if there are any similar issues already created. 
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs whenever possible; they are immensely
  helpful.

## Pull Requests

* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Include the general description along with the technical overview.
* Include the links to the tickets from Pivotal Tracker that are related to this pull request.


## Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
